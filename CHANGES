06-jun-22   * MIARMA 0.1.2.1 R2022
	      New branch for modern releases of MATLAB.

            * autoarmaord 0.2.1
            - Print the length of the segment used for finding the optimal order.

            - autoarmaord now requires input rep_lim
            - autoarmaord uses optionally mseg parameter to trim the segment to calculate the optimal order in armaord. If the trimmed segment does not pass the tests the full segment is used.
            - fraction_cgsa.m is no longer used, only fastCGSA.m is necessary
            
	    * armaint 1.4.2
            - Minor fix to solve a compatibility issue with modern MATLAB releases.

            * autoarmaord 0.2
            - Added parameter rep_lim that controls limit in the repetition.
            - Several crash tests.
            - Added parameter mseg to trim the segment.
            - The search is repeated if the tests are not fulfilled for the trimmed segment and the max length segment is used in that case.

	    - Minor: regsamp no longer necessary

	    * fastCGSA.m 0.2
	    - frac is the fraction of fractal component
