We used a forward-backward predictor based on autoregressive moving-average modelling (ARMA) in the time domain. The algorithm is particularly suitable for replacing invalid data such as those present in the light curves of CoRoT satellite due to the passing through the South Atlantic Anomaly, and eventually for the data gathered by the NASA planet hunter Kepler.
